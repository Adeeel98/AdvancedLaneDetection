# Advanced Lane Detection using computer vision
Drivable area detection can be considered as the most important module in any self driving car. This module gives the car the ability to detect any drivable region and also allows the car to make decision as steering , accelerating or changing the lane. In this repo you can find an advanced way for detecting the lanes and measuring the curvature for each lane.
